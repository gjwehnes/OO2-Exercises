  Create a new class "UtensilCheck" that will provide information on what to include in a take-out order
  of a MenuItem
  
  The class will contain several static boolean methods, each of which take a MenuItem in as a parameter:
    -requireFork
    -requireKnife
    -requireSpoon
    -requireStraw
    
  You can look at the unit test to determine the correct return value for each item. Generally, all Sandwiches
  require both knife and fork; Salads require only a fork; Drinks require neither knife nor fork; a Drink usually
  requires a straw, unless it is a Cappuccino, in which case it requires a spoon but not a straw.
  
  To determine the type of your parameter, you will need to use the instanceof keyword inside of a linked
  conditional statement. Do not use the .class method of the parameter.
