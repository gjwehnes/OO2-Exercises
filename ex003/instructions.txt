The next two exercises are adapted from the AP 2014 exam.

The menu at a lunch counter includes a variety of sandwiches, salads, and drinks. The menu also allows a
customer to create a "trio," which consists of three menu items: a sandwich, a salad, and a drink. The price
of the trio is the sum of the two highest-priced menu items in the trio; one item with the lowest price is free.

Each menu item has a name and a price. The four types of menu items are represented by the four classes
Sandwich, Salad, Drink, and Trio. All four classes implement the MenuItem interface.

The menu allows customers to create Trio menu items, each of which includes a sandwich, a salad, and a
drink.

1. Create a class hierarchy:

A. Write the Trio class that implements the MenuItem interface. Your implementation must include a
constructor that takes three parameters representing a Sandwich, Salad, and Drink object 

B. Create the Drink, Salad, and Sandwich classes. All these classes should implement the MenuItem. Ensure that you
properly encapsulate your instance variables.

Once you have your class hierarchy set up, your code will need to implement the following behaviour

1. The name of the Trio consists of the names of the sandwich, salad, and drink, in that order, each
separated by "/" and followed by a space and then "Trio". 

2. The price of the Trio is the sum of the two
highest-priced items in the Trio; one item with the lowest price is free.

e.g.
	A trio consisting of a cheeseburger, spinach salad, and an orange soda would have the name
	"Cheeseburger/Spinach Salad/Orange Soda Trio" and a price of $4.00 (the two highest prices
	are $2.75 and $1.25).
	
	Similarly, a trio consisting of a club sandwich, coleslaw, and a cappuccino would have the
	name "Club Sandwich/Coleslaw/Cappuccino Trio" and a price of $6.25 (the two highest prices
	are $2.75 and $3.50).
